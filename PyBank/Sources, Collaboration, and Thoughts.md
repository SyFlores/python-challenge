### Thoughts
- What is being asked?
  - Make a repository and clone it locally
    - This will require a syncing with bash
  - Read in files
    - Make sure this is done from a local repo that’s synced to GitHub so it’ll be replicable
  - Return the number of unique values in the first column
  - Return the average change in the first column
- Pseudocode
  - Unique values in a list. There are two possible solutions:
    - There exists a function that dedupes the values in a column and we can then take the length of the that column/list
      - Looks like Pandas can do this easily… come back to this option later
    - Loop through each row
      - Add the date value to a running list if it meets the following condition
        - Date NOT IN RunningList
      - If the condition is met, append that value to the list
      - Finally, use len() to output the number of unique values in the list
  - Average change
    - Calculate the difference and store them in a list
    - Then divide by the length of that list. This should be one less than number of differences which should be one less than the number of months (86).
    - Loop through each row
      - Take the “row” and find a way to use “row” + 1 to perform the calculation: ROW[“row” + 1] - ROW[“row”]
      - Then we add that into a tracking list
        - This should only run under the condition if ROW[“row” + 1] exists
  - Dictionary
    - Chose to create dictionaries to make referencing these values more flexible
      - Make lists from each column and read them into a “Date” and “Profit/Losses” dictionary
    - Used this to change how we loop to find and create a list of differences
  - Matching the date to the min and max
    - We need to grab the index at which the min and max changes happen
      - Use this integer to specify the index in the budget[“Date”] dictionary
    - Add 1 to the index
      - The index of the diffs are lined up to correspond with the starting month, so adding one to the index will change the reference in budget[“Date”] to the closing month
      - We want this as the month specified should reflect the changes that have just happened
