### Thoughts
- What is being asked?
  - Calculate the number of votes
    - We might want to check if all rows are votes
    - It appears that all rows are votes
  - A complete list of candidates that received votes
    - We need a unique list, checking through every row
  - Percentage and number of votes for each candidate
- Pseudocode
  - Return a list of candidates from the 'for row in csvreader' loop
  - Use that list to run conditionals in a loop to update count variables for each
  - Use a loop to autocreate a dictionary
  - Results should also be printed from a loop
