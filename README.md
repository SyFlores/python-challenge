# python-challenge
We will be creating Python scripts to do the following:

---

## **PyBank**
- We will be doing basic analysis of a company's financial data
- Our script will primarily be run from the *budget_data.csv* file
- We will be looking to output the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- This output should be both printed to the terminal as well as export a file with the results

### *Output Format:*
Financial Analysis  
\----------------------------  
Total Months: 86  
Total: $38382578  
Average  Change: $-2315.12  
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)  
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

## **PyPoll**
- We will be modernizing the vote counting process for a won
- Our script will primarily be run from the *election_data.csv* file
- We will be looking to output the following:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote
- This output should be both printed to the terminal as well as export a file with the results

### *Output Format:*
Election Results  
\-------------------------  
Total Votes: 3521001
